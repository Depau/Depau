### Oh hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Italian CS nerd living in Milan. I like putting Arch Linux on things. I like hardware that doesn't phone home, unless that home is mine.

I have a separate place for forked repos: [@depau-forks](https://github.com/depau-forks)

Wanna see what I enjoy working on? Here's a few projects of mine I really like:

- LevIoT ([hw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-sw)) (`KiCAD`/`Py`) is a custom PCB for my home air purifier
- Wi-Se ([hw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-sw)) (`KICAD`/`C++`) is a wireless UART adapter board
- I love playing [AudioTrip VR](http://www.kinemotik.com/audiotrip/); I made a [custom songs sync app](https://github.com/ATchoreography/atcd_choreo_sync) (`Dart`) and a [custom map viewer](https://github.com/ATchoreography/audiotrip_choreo_viewer) (`C++`)
- [EtchDroid](https://github.com/EtchDroid/EtchDroid) (`Kotlin`) lets you rootlessly write GNU/Linux distro images to USB drives on Android
- I made a [rootless F-Droid privileged extension](https://github.com/depau/fdroid_shizuku_privileged_extension) (`Kotlin`) that uses Shizuku
- I made a [viewer](https://github.com/depau/dso138-viewer) (`Py`) for the DSO138 portable oscilloscope waveform data
