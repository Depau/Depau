### Oh hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Italian CS nerd living in Milan. I like putting Arch Linux on things. I like hardware that doesn't phone home, unless that home is mine.

I have a separate place for forked repos: [@depau-forks](https://github.com/depau-forks)

Wanna see what I enjoy working on? Here's a few projects of mine I really like:

- [EtchDroid](https://github.com/EtchDroid/EtchDroid) (`Kotlin`) is a popular app that lets you rootlessly write GNU/Linux distro images to USB drives on Android
- LevIoT ([hw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/leviot-sw)) (`KiCAD`/`Py`) is a custom PCB for my home air purifier
- Wi-Se ([hw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-hw)/[sw](https://github.com/depau/wi-se-sw)) (`KICAD`/`C++`) is a wireless UART adapter board
- [meross2mqtt](https://github.com/depau/meross2mqtt) (`Py`) bridges Meross smart plugs to home automation software via MQTT, with [Homie](https://homieiot.github.io/) autodiscovery!
- My [shitty DNS proxy](https://github.com/depau/shitty-dns-proxy/) (`Go`) is very shitty but it has been solving all my home network DNS woes since 2022!
- My [SAPI Speech Server](https://github.com/depau/SAPISpeechServer) (`C#/.NET`, `Docker`, `Wine`) makes Windows Text-To-Speech voices work on Linux!
- My [WearOS World Clock App](https://github.com/depau/wearos-world-clock-tile) (`Kotlin`) is slick and useful, and it includes watchface tiles.
